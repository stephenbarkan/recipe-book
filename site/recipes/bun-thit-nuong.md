1. Slice the **uncooked pork** thinly, about 1/8". It helps to slightly freeze it beforehand.
2. Mince **garlic** and **shallots**. Mix in a bowl with **sugar**, **fish sauce**, **thick soy sauce**, **pepper**, and **oil** until sugar dissolves.
3. Marinate the meat for 1 hour, or overnight for better results.
4. Bake the pork at 375 F for 10-15 minutes or until about 80% cooked. Finish cooking by broiling in the oven until a nice golden brown color develops, flipping the pieces midway. Don't take your eyes off the broiler!
5. Assemble your bowl with **veggies**, **noodles**, and **garnish**.
