1. In a large pot, heat **coconut oil** over medium heat. Add **onion** and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
2. Stir in **garlic** and **ginger** and cook for another minute.
3. Add **carrots**, **coconut milk**, **vegetable broth**, and **Thai red curry paste** to the pot. Stir to combine.
4. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and let the soup simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the carrots are tender.
5. Use an immersion blender or transfer soup to a regular blender to puree the soup until smooth. If using a regular blender, be sure to let the soup cool slightly before blending to avoid burns or explosions.

7. Serve hot, optionally garnished with toppings such as fresh **cilantro**, a squeeze of **lime juice**, **pumpkin seeds**, chopped **peanuts**, or **sesame seeds**.
