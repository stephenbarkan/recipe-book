1. Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 375°F. Press **tofu** firmly between paper towels to remove excess moisture. Cut into 1 1/2–inch cubes and set aside.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together **miso paste**, **2 tablespoons lemon juice**, **lemon zest**, and **1 tablespoon oil**. Season generously with **salt** and **pepper**. Add tofu and toss to coat.
3. Spread tofu evenly over a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Place in oven and bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Sauce may darken a little against the foil; this is fine. Set tofu aside.
4. Combine **nut milk** and **cauliflower** in a small saucepan. Season with **salt** and bring to a simmer. Cook until cauliflower is tender, about 10 minutes. Purée mixture using a hand blender or countertop blender. Set aside.
5. Heat remaining **2 tablespoons vegetable oil** in a large saucepan or saucier over medium heat until shimmering. Add **garlic**, **ginger**, and **chilies** and cook, stirring, until fragrant and lightly browned, about 1 minute. Add **coriander**, **cumin**, and **turmeric** and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add **spinach** and **arugula** one handful at a time, stirring and adding more as the greens wilt (see note).
6. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until greens are fully wilted, about 5 minutes. Stir in **cauliflower purée** and continue to cook until greens are very tender, about 5 minutes longer. Stir in **tofu cubes** and heat through. Stir in remaining **lemon juice**, season with **salt**, adjust consistency with a little water if necessary, and serve.
