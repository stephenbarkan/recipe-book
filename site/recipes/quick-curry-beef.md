1.  In a medium bowl, combine the **flank steak** with the **water**, **cornstarch**, **oil**, **oyster sauce**, **light soy sauce**, and **baking soda**. Marinate for 20 minutes.
2.  Heat a wok over high heat until smoking.
3.  Add **2 tablespoons of the oil**, then add the **flank steak** in one layer.
4.  Sear the flank steak undisturbed for 30 seconds, then stir-fry just until it turns opaque (it's okay if it's still slightly rare; it will be cooked again). Turn off the heat and transfer the beef to a plate, leaving behind any residual fat.
5.  Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining **tablespoon oil**, along with the **onion** and **bell peppers**. Stir-fry for 1 minute.
6.  Stir in the **chicken stock**, **curry powder**, **turmeric**, **salt**, and **sugar**. Bring to a simmer.
7.  Combine the **cornstarch** and **water** in a small bowl to make a slurry. Add about three-fourths of the slurry to the wok and simmer for 1 minute, until the sauce has thickened enough to coat a spoon. If the sauce isn't thick enough, add more slurry. If it's too thick, add more chicken stock. Check the seasoning and add salt if needed.
8.  Stir in the **cooked beef** and cook for another 30 seconds. Serve.
