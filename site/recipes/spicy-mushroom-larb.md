1. Coarsely chop or crush **peanuts** into small pieces; set aside.

2. Heat **3 Tbsp. oil** in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Add **mushrooms** and cook, undisturbed, until bottom sides are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Toss and continue to cook, tossing occasionally and reducing heat as needed to avoid scorching, until golden brown all over, about 4 minutes more.
3. Add **scallions**, **garlic**, and **ginger**, followed by remaining **1 Tbsp. oil**, and cook, stirring often, until softened and fragrant, about 2 minutes.
4. Remove from heat; season lightly with salt. Mix in **shallot**, **chile**, **mint**, **fish sauce**, and **half of peanuts**. Taste and season with more **salt** if needed.
5. Transfer larb to a large bowl. Serve with **lettuce**, **lime wedges**, and remaining **peanuts** alongside.
