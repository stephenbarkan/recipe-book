1. In a large bowl, mix the **flour**,**cornmeal**, **salt**, **pepper**, **corn**, **jalapeno**, and **kale**.
2. In a medium bowl, lightly beat the **eggs**, **2 tbs butter**, and **milk** to combine.
3. In a large skillet, heat the remaining **butter**. Add the **onion** and sauté until golden.
4. Pour the wet ingredients and onion into the dry and mix until blended.
5. Drop 1/4 cup of the batter per cake into the skillet, adding more oil as needed to keep cakes from sticking. Cook until cakes begin to bubble, about 3 minutes, then flip and cook until the other side is golden, 1 or 2 minutes longer.
6. Serve warm and with a bright, creamy sauce.
