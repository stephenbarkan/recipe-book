1. Preheat oven to 350°. Lightly coat 8½x4½" loaf pan with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper, leaving a generous overhang on long sides. Whisk **flour**, **baking soda**, and **salt** in a medium bowl.
2. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat **brown sugar**, **mascarpone**, and **butter** in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add **eggs** one at a time, beating to blend after each addition and scraping down sides and bottom of bowl as needed.
3. Reduce speed to low, add flour mixture, and mix until just combined. Add **bananas** and mix just until combined. Fold in **chocolate** and/or **walnuts**, if using. Scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth top.
4. Bake bread until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 60–65 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let bread cool in pan 1 hour. Turn out bread and let cool completely before slicing.
