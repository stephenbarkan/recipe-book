1. In a bowl pour **warm water** and add **sugar** and **yeast**. Mix well, cover, and keep it aside for about 5 minutes or until frothy and foamy.
2. Mix **bread flour**, **flax meal**, and **salt** in another bowl.
3. Now, in a stand mixer’s bowl add flour and salt mixture.
4. Slowly add foamy yeast water in the flour mixture. Attach the dough hook to the mixer and turn on the mixer to medium-low speed. Gradually add the remaining yeast mixture until the dough comes together.
5. Continue kneading on medium speed for 3 to 4 minutes, or until soft, smooth, and slightly sticky dough forms (If it’s too sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time).
6. Now, pour **2 Tbsp olive oil** and knead for 2-3 minutes. Turn off the mixer and take the dough out of the bowl and form a dough ball.
7. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise for about 1-2 hours or until it doubled in size in a warm place.
8. Divide the dough into 6 equal parts. Shape each portion into a round ball. Place the dough balls/loaves on a parchment paper-lined baking tray.
9. Cover and let rise in a warm place for about 15-20 minutes. After 20 minutes, uncover the dough and brush the buns with **milk**.
10. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. While preheating the oven, place a cast iron pan/oven-safe pan at the bottom rack of the oven for a water bath. Meanwhile, to give the steam to the bread, bring **2-3 cups of water** to a boil (steam will help to give a crunchy crust to the bread bowl).
11. Place the tray in the oven's center rack. Carefully pour hot water into the pan on the bottom rack and close the oven door. Bake bread bowls for 20 to 25 minutes or until it becomes golden brown on the outside.
12. Allow bread to cool on a wire rack for 15-20 minutes before slicing into.
