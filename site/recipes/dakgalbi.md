1. Make the marinade: Finely chop **¼ medium white onion**. Peel one **1" piece ginger** with a spoon. Smash **3 garlic cloves**. Slice ginger and garlic. Transfer to a blender and add **5 Tbsp. gochujang** (Korean hot pepper paste), **3 Tbsp. unseasoned rice wine or dry sherry**, **2 Tbsp. raw or light brown sugar**, **2 Tbsp. soy sauce**, **1 Tbsp. gochugaru**, and **1 tsp. mild Korean curry powder**. Purée on high until a loose paste forms (this may take up to 2 minutes depending on your blender). Transfer marinade to a large bowl.
2. Cut **1 lb. skinless, boneless chicken thighs** and cut into 1" cubes, add to marinade, and toss to coat. Cover bowl and chill at least 30 minutes and up to 36 hours.
3. Meanwhile, slice **¼ small green cabbage** as thinly as possible. Peel **1 small sweet potato**, halve lengthwise, then slice crosswise into 1/8"-thick half-moons. Trim stems from **8 Thai purple basil leaves**, then cut leaves into quarters.
4. If using fresh rice cakes, place **36 rice cakes** in a large bowl and pour in water to cover. Soak until rice cakes are soft, 7–10 minutes. Drain well in a colander. If using frozen rice cakes, bring a large saucepan or small pot of water to a boil and drop rice cakes into pot, stirring constantly to make sure they don’t stick together. Cook 1 minute, then drain well in a colander. Drizzle **½ tsp. extra-virgin olive oil** or vegetable oil over rice cakes and toss to coat (this will prevent them from sticking together).
5. Heat remaining **3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil** or vegetable oil a large skillet over medium. Combine **chicken** and any remaining **marinade**, **cabbage**, **sweet potato**, and **rice cakes** in skillet and cook, stirring often, until chicken is cooked through and sweet potato is tender, 15–17 minutes. Add quartered **basil leaves** and cook, stirring, until slightly wilted, about 30 seconds.
