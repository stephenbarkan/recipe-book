1. Preheat oven to 425°.

2. Crush 8 **garlic cloves** with the flat side of a chef's knife and remove peel. Cut ½ stick **butter** into small pieces.

3. Empty 28 oz. **can of tomatoes** into a 13x9" baking dish and crush lightly with your hands.

4. Scatter **garlic**, **butter pieces**, 2 **anchovies**, and ½ tsp. **red pepper flakes** over tomatoes; season with **salt** and **black pepper**.

5. Roast tomatoes, tossing halfway through, until garlic is very soft and mixture is thick and jammy, 35–40 minutes.

6. While tomatoes are roasting, bring a large pot of water (4-6 qt.) to a boil over high heat and add a small fistful of **salt**.

7. Remove pan from oven and let sauce cool slightly. Using a potato masher or fork, break up garlic and tomatoes until mixture looks like coarse applesauce.

8. Cook 12 oz. **bucatini or spaghetti** in pot of boiling water, stirring occasionally with tongs, according to package instructions for al dente.

9. Toward end of cook time, use a heatproof measuring cup to scoop out and reserve ½ cup **pasta cooking liquid**. Drain pasta in a colander; reserve pot.

10. Return pasta to pot and add tomato sauce and pasta cooking liquid. Cook over medium-high heat, tossing with tongs, until sauce coats pasta, about 3 minutes.

11. Divide pasta among plates. Serve topped with Parmesan and more red pepper flakes.
