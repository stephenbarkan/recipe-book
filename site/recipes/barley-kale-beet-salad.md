1. Whisk ¼ cup **oil**, **white wine vinegar**, and **sugar** in a large bowl to blend; season with **salt** and **pepper**.

2. Add **kale** and **shallots**; mix until completely coated. Cover and chill until kale is tender, at least 3 hours.

3. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375°.

4. Peel **beets** and cut beets into small cubes. Arrange beets in a small baking dish and drizzle with a little oil. Season with **salt** and turn beets to coat. Bake beets until tender when pierced with a thin knife, about 30 minutes.

5. Cook **barley** in a large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 45 minutes. Drain barley and spread out on a rimmed baking sheet; let cool completely.

6. Add beets, barley, and feta to kale. Drizzle salad with remaining 2 tablespoons **oil** and 2 tablespoons **rice vinegar**; fold gently to combine. Season to taste with **pepper** and more rice vinegar, if desired.
