1. Heat the oven to 450 degrees. Brush a sheet pan all over with **1 tablespoon olive oil**.
2. Place the **potatoes** in a large pot and fill with enough **water** to cover by 1 inch; add **2 tablespoons salt**. Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower and simmer, uncovered, for 15 to 18 minutes, until the potatoes are just fork tender. Pour into a colander to drain, then return the cooked potatoes to the pot off the heat to help any remaining moisture evaporate.
3. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the **fish sauce**, **lime juice**, **rice vinegar**, **chile**, **soy sauce**, **sugar** and **garlic**, then stir in the **cilantro** and **scallions**.
4. Place the **potatoes** on the prepared sheet pan. Using the bottom of a measuring cup, gently smash each potato until it’s about ½-inch thick. Drizzle remaining **3 tablespoons olive oil** over the potatoes and carefully flip to coat both sides in oil. Sprinkle with **½ teaspoon salt** and roast for 30 to 40 minutes, until golden brown and crisp.
5. Transfer the potatoes to a platter, sprinkle lightly with **salt**, then spoon the sauce on top. Garnish with **cilantro leaves** and serve hot.
