1. Wrap **tofu** in a clean kitchen towel and place in a shallow baking dish or on a rimmed baking sheet. Weigh down with a heavy object. Let sit at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour.

2. Meanwhile, coarsely crack **peppercorns** in a spice mill or with a mortar and pestle; set aside.

3. Finely grate **garlic** and **ginger** into a small bowl; set aside.

4. Unwrap tofu and cut into 1" cubes. Transfer tofu to a medium bowl. Add **cornstarch** and **salt** and toss gently to coat tofu.

5. Heat **oil** in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Arrange tofu in skillet in a single layer and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crisp all over, 6–8 minutes. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer to a large plate or baking sheet.

6. Reduce heat to medium and add reserved **cracked pepper** to skillet. Cook, stirring often, until very fragrant, about 2 minutes, then add **asparagus** and cook, stirring often, until bright green, about 1 minute.

7. Add reserved **garlic** and **ginger** and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute.

8. Return tofu to pan and gently toss to combine. Increase heat to medium-high, add **soy sauce** and **sugar**, and cook, tossing occasionally, until sauce thickens slightly, about 3 minutes.

9. Remove from heat and add **vinegar**. Taste and add more salt and/or vinegar if needed.

10. To serve, divide **rice** among plates and top with tofu mixture.
